            Frontend developer based in Belgrade, Serbia
              My story is not that long, i discovered programming 
              in collage and fell in love with it, especially 
              front end part as you can tell by my title. 
              I mostly build websites and web apps using
               ReactJs as my primary source. I also do some
                backend stuff (if needed), with NodeJS 
                (im using NestJS framework). You can check 
                out some of my work here.
